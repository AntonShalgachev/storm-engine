## .GM to .OBJ file converter

### Requirements
In order to run this script you need:
- Python 3+
- Some .gm files from one game

### How to
To run the script, just run
``python .\gm-to-obj.py`` 

After that you will be asked for a .gm file path. In my case (windows) it was:
``E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Sea Dogs To Each His Own\RESOURCE\MODELS\Ships\Manowar1\Manowar1.gm``
